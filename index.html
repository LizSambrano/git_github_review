    <h1>Git and Github review</h1>
    <p>I decided to review the Git and Github section on
        the Odin Project as I wanted to fully grasp how 
        to create files via the command line and push
        to Github via the command line. In my previous
        project on Github titled "odin_recipes" I 
        made commits via VS code. So I decided to create 
        a small HTML project in order to practice fully 
        doing all commits via the command line.

    <p>The following is a link to the <a href="git_github_review/about">about</a> 
        page in order to test my memory on linking 
        another page but later on commiting it all 
        via the terminal.
